Vote now for best overall.\n\nThumbnail Zoom Plus is a Firefox plug-in which shows a full-size image popup when you hover over a thumbnail or image link.\n\nWhen you hover your mouse over a thumbnail or a link to an image or YouTube video, the add-on displays the full-size image or video still-frame in a floating window.\n\nThe image remains visible until you move the mouse outside the thumb, click the mouse, or press Escape. It’s quick and easy to move the mouse from one thumbnail to another to see the corresponding full-size images. For details see our User Manual.\n\nSupported sites include Amazon, Baidu, Bing, Facebook, Flickr, Google, HuffingtonPost, IMDb, LinkedIn, Netflix, New York Times, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Yandex.ru, YouTube, Wikipedia, WordPress, Yahoo Images, and many more. For a more complete list see the Compatible Sites page.\n\nThe add-on also supports any site which links directly to image files, imgur pages, or YouTube videos, including reddit.com and many others (this is enabled by the \"Others\" checkbox in the add-on's preferences).\n\nThe add-on's preferences and toolbar menu let you enable or disable sites as desired. Preferences also let you configure the delay until the popup appears, how large the image is zoomed, whether captions should be shown, whether images are added to history, and more.\n\nNote that if the popped-up image wouldn't be at least 20% larger than the thumb, it won't show the popup image. This is a feature, not a bug. If you don't mind the image overlapping the thumb, turn on the \"Show pictures using all available space\" preference.\n\nYou can save the full-size image using \"Download Enlarged Image\" from the context (right-click) menu.\n\nHotkeys let you open the popped-up image in a new tab or window, zoom larger or smaller, open preferences, and more.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nVisit our site for the user manual and announcements.\n\nYou can find Thumbnail Zoom Plus on Facebook\n\nIf you have any problems, please contact the developer at firefox.add.on@davidadler.name, via our Facebook page, or file a bug report on our Issues page so we can improve it (instead of just giving a negative review).\n\nTRY THE BETA VERSION\n\nIf you want to try the latest-and-greatest, and don't mind the risk of a bug or two, consider installing the beta version.

New tabs opened from links (or etc.) are automatically attached to the current tab. If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2. Multiple Tab Handler ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838 ) can work with this. drag-and-do features of it will be more useful. Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttachNewTabsAsChildren\" by about:config. Then, you'll see tree only when you make a tree by hand, ex. drag and drop.\n\nSimilar Extensions:\nPano (tree in the sidebar, based on Panorama) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pano/\nTab Utilities (all-in-one addon for tabbed browsing, including vertical tab bar and tab groups) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-utilities/\nTab Kit (all-in-one addon for tabbed browsing, including vertical tab bar and tree of tabs) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/5447/\nVertical Tabs (alternative for TST + Multiple Tab Handler) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/108862/\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFor developers, Tree Style Tab provides public API. By the API, you'll be able to...\n\n* Open additional information for the current page as a \"child\" tab.\n* Get tabs by the tree structure. For example, \"parent\", array of \"children\", next/previous \"sibling\", and so on.\n* Collapse and expand sub tree.\n* Observe changing of collapsed state of sub tree.\n\nMore information, see: http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/30/30844.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"324","height":"360","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/30/30844.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"135","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Overview"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/16/16932.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"212","height":"143","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/16/16932.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"134","caption":"Drag-and-drop of tabs"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/16/16933.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"296","height":"259","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/16/16933.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"171","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"with \"Multiple Tab Handler\""},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/16/16934.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"294","height":"345","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/16/16934.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"127","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"with \"Informational Tab\""},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/30/30845.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"632","height":"139","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/30/30845.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"43","caption":"Horizontal tree tabs below the content area"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/30/30846.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"273","height":"296","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/30/30846.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"138","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"\"Metal\" theme, a built-in style for Mac OS X"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/302164/tree_style_tab-0.15.2015030601-fx.xpi?src=api","size":1284574,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":1153,"totalDownloads":2584968,"weeklyDownloads":3972,"dailyUsers":95946,"updateDate":1429002795000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues"},{"id":"{6AC85730-7D0F-4de0-B3FA-21142DD85326}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/271-32.png?modified=1353155716","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/271-64.png?modified=1353155716"},"name":"ColorZilla","type":"extension","version":"2.8","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Alex Sirota","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/alex-sirota/?src=api"},"description":"Advanced Eyedropper, Color Picker, Gradient Generator and other colorful goodies...","fullDescription":"Advanced Eyedropper, Color Picker, Gradient Generator and other colorful goodies.\n\nWith ColorZilla you can get a color reading from any point in your browser, quickly adjust this color and paste it into another program.

It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/298890/vimperator-3.9-fx.xpi?src=api","size":680628,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$10.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":170,"totalDownloads":655066,"weeklyDownloads":1597,"dailyUsers":31029,"updateDate":1425875696000,"supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org"},{"id":"{e4a8a97b-f2ed-450b-b12d-ee082ba24781}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/748-32.png?modified=1402930904","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/748-64.png?modified=1402930904"},"name":"Greasemonkey","type":"extension","version":"3.1","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Anthony Lieuallen","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/anthony-lieuallen/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Aaron Boodman","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/aaron-boodman/?src=api"},{"name":"Johan Sundström","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/ecmanaut/?src=api"}],"description":"Customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.","fullDescription":"Allows you to customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.\n\nYou can write your own scripts, too.

Record and replay repetitious work. If you love the Firefox web browser, but are tired of repetitive tasks like visiting the same sites every days, filling out forms, and remembering passwords, then iMacros for Firefox is the solution you’ve been dreaming of! ***Whatever you do with Firefox, iMacros can automate it.***","fullDescription":"iMacros was designed to automate the most repetitious tasks on the web. If there’s an activity you have to do repeatedly, just record it in iMacros. The next time you need to do it, the entire macro will run at the click of a button! With iMacros, you can quickly and easily fill out web forms, remember passwords, create a webmail notifier, download information from other sites, scrape the Web (get data from multiple sites), and more. You can keep the macros on your computer for your own use, or share them with others by embedding them on your homepage, blog, company Intranet or any social bookmarking service. The uses are limited only by your imagination!\n\nHere are just a few examples of how you can use iMacros to automate your web browser.\n\n(1) Form Filler & Password Manager\n\nWith iMacros for Firefox, you no longer need to check the same sites every day, remembering passwords, and filling out web forms. iMacros is the only form filler that can autofill web forms that stretch over several pages. All information is stored in human-readable, plain text files that can be easily edited. Passwords are stored securely with 256-Bit AES encryption. Users memorize only one master password and iMacros remembers all the others, providing a truly automated login experience, that beats the Solution to Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO).\n\n(2) Automated Download & Upload\n\niMacros can automate the download of images, files, or entire pages (with or without images). In the other direction, it can automate the upload of data to websites. You can use variables inside the macros and import data from CSV files. iMacros includes a user agent switcher, PDF download and Flash, and ad- and image-blocking functions. When combined and controlled with Javascript, the recorded Macros can script even very complex tasks.\n\n(3) Data Extraction, Web Scraping/Mining & Enterprise Data Mash-Ups\n\nThe iMacros EXTRACT command automatically reads data from a website and exports it to CSV files – the exact opposite of filling out forms. iMacros includes full Unicode support and works with every language, including multi-byte languages such as Chinese. You can use this feature to download stock quotes, gather and compare web store prices, and more.\n\n(4) Web Testing\n\nWeb professionals can use iMacros for functional, performance, and regression testing of web applications. The built-in STOPWATCH command captures precise web page response times. iMacros also includes support for many AJAX elements.\n\n(5) Social Scripting (Social Bookmarking)\n\nSharing your favorite iMacros with friends and colleagues is easy. Simply right-click the macro to add it as a bookmark, or select \"Run Everywhere\" and embed the complete macro in a simple link. You can send the link to others, or embed it on your homepage, blog, or company intranet. Instead of telling your site visitors how to fill out a form, let iMacros do it for them. All the information is stored inside the link as a text string, with nothing stored on our servers, which is why iMacros work on intranets, too.
